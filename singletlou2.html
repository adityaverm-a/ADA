					<p>Welcome to SWG's Walkthrough/Guide to Batman: Arkham Knight. Here you will find the Walkthrough to the main story campaign of the game: City of Fear. Be warned that there are fair amount of spoilers throughout the story, but this guide
						will attempt to avoid mentioning them when possible.</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Prologue</h4>
							<p>As the Prologue to Batman: Arkham Knight begins, you’ll be treated to a scene of the cremation of a very notable deceased figure. When the camera centers around his face, simply use any combination of button inputs or control sticks
								to light the fire and keep up the blaze until the body becomes burnt.After the short monologue, you’ll find yourself not in control of Batman, but an ordinary police officer of the GCPD. As he enters the diner you’ll be treated to the
								first person view, so feel free to take in the sights, and note the small details like the newspaper headlines and missing persons reports. Eventually a patron of the diner will alert you to someone smoking in the far corner. Walk
								around and inspect the diner if you wish, and eventually make your way to the far left corner and accost the patron. Naturally, things go downhill fast. After the lengthy cutscene, you’ll be in control of Batman from his perch in the
								Chinatown section of Bleake Island - one of the three main islands of Gotham City. Your first objective is to meet with Jim Gordon of the GCPD, and he’s waiting for you on the roof of the nearby building marked by the large bat
								symbol. Re-acclimate yourself to the traversal controls of Batman, and try gliding, diving, and grappling with the grapnel boost to give yourself more airtime. Make your way over to the large GCPD building and talk to Gordon. He’s
								been tracking an armored carrier driving through Bleake Island, and thinks it may be the key to tracking Scarecrow. As you leave, you’ll be notified that a patrol car has gone missing, and you’ll need to intervene and find it.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Even the Odds</h4>
							<p>Now that it’s finally time to Even the Odds, press the button prompt to summon the Batmobile into the fray. This mean behemoth of metal is an unstoppable force on four wheels, and you’ll be able to tear through the streets destroying
								most everything on your path. Start by tailing the military vehicle that nearly ran you over. As you approach, the car will start firing a rocket launcher. Note the blue line of arrows that marks the missile's intended path. If it
								turns red, quickly swerve to avoid, or press the dodge button and move to one side for a side swipe. Keep on its tail and you’ll see a homing icon being locking. If you remain close and keep the enemy vehicle centered, the circle will
								eventually tighten and let you fire the Batmobile’s Immobilizer Cannon. You’ll need to do this several times to take out the vehicle - and you can alternatively ram the vehicle or side swipe into it for additional damage.

								When the vehicle is finally taken down, track down the dazed driver and interrogate him for information. He seems to know about a certain safehouse that Scarecrow is using in Chinatown. Once he’s taken care of, hop back in the
								Batmobile and race back into the Chinatown district of Bleake Island.Drive into the heart of Chinatown and follow the batsignal until you reach a tall building. Grapple up to the top floor to listen in on some chatter and find out
								who’s being held captive inside. There are a few thugs inside the room, with a couple more waiting outside. To crash the party, bust through the glass ceiling and take on the 8 or so militia thugs - and be sure to make use of the
								environmental objects to perform instant takedowns.

								When the thugs are beaten, Scarecrow will appear on screen to deliver another message, and Poison Ivy will let Batman in on what she knows about Scarecrow’s plans. After the ensuing cutscene, Ivy and Batman will be on the streets just
								as more of the militia intercept with an imposing looking drone tank. Luckily Batman’s new ride can do more than go fast, and can also be used remotely. Switch to the Remote Batmobile controls on your gadget selection, and witness the
								power of Battle Mode.

								It’s not over yet however, as 6 more Drones will be on the scene shortly. Get used to the Batmobile’s strafing controls in Battle Mode, and face the oncoming tanks. The combat is similar to Batman’s regular combat - hit enemies to
								gain a combo meter, and avoid getting hit to not lose your meter. You’ll see the enemy tank’s line of fire a few moments before they actually fire, giving you time to get out of the way and counter-attack. Just keep moving, strafing,
								dodging, and firing, and they’ll be toast in no time.

								If you’re still trying to get used to the Batmobile’s controls - your in luck! Batman will request a Weapon Energy Diagnostics run. Head to the nearby AR Challenge to learn about the controls, how to build up energy to release a
								missile barrage.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Find Scarecrow's Location</h4>
							<p>In order to Find Scarecrow's Location, you'll have to meet up with Oracle at her Clock Tower base near Chinatown. Drive the Batmobile over and grapple up to the roof. Look around for a hidden entrance among the roof tiles and drop on
								in.

								Barbara Gordon has a neat little loft, but there's more here than meets the eye. Use Detective Vision to find an interactive statue bust. Using it will unlock her computer where you can begin hunting for clues. Your next task requires
								some major antenna power, which you can find back at Panessa Studios. Drive on back to the studio and grapple up onto the roof to find the power station, which of course is shorting out. It will need a boost from another source, and
								that source is your Batmobile. But how to get it onto the roof? Lucius Fox will send in the Batmobile's Power Winch upgrade en route via the Batwing, so hop back in the car and drive it up around the nearby lighthouse.

								With the upgrade enabled, transform into Battle Mode and launch the the winch at the nearby sign, and pull back until the entire thing collapses. Now back up a bit, and use a Batmobile's afterburner to launch yourself onto the nearby
								roof. Once across, look for another winch point on the roof and peel it back to create a new ramp onto a higher point of the roof.

								From here, use Battle Mode to quickly and precisely navigate the narrow bridges to the other side of the building. When you at last get to a dead end facing the main building, look for one more winch point to latch onto, then drive
								off the edge and hoist the car up the side of the building. Once up, drive over and plug the winch into the power supply, then rev the car's engine along with the marked area to supply power. However, one antenna is not enough, and
								you'll need to activate another one nearby. Leave the Batmobile where it is and glide over to the Falcone Shipping Yard. You'll find that you're not alone, as the lone worker there has been accosted by thugs who have taken up
								residence in the building. Get to a vantage point and lure two thugs out with a batarang to the door. Wait for them to split up and take them out one by one. The last three aren't as stupid, and won't leave the safety of the building.
								Time to bring in the heavy guns.

								Fox will send in a brand new batsuit to equip, and this design will greatly improve Batman's performance. You'll now be able to glider faster and farther, counter enemies into a throw, eject from the Batmobile like a spring - and most
								importantly - use the suit's new reflexes to take out multiple armed enemies at once using the Fear Takedown. If you want, you can test out these new abilities with the AR Challenges, or go right back into the fray.

								Head to the side of the building and hop in a floor grate to travel underneath the building. When an enemy is highlighted, spring forth and take out all three enemies in succession. With the worker saved and the second antenna powered
								up, check out your gauntlet comms to find Scarecrow's location. You'll need to rotate both the Panessa Studios and Falcone antenna over sources of radiation to find the one that matches Scarecrow. Swivel both antennas to scan the area
								on the far right to find his hideout - Ace Chemicals.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>The End</h4>
							<p>(Before you continue, know that this segment contains heavy story spoilers.)</p>
							<p>After defeating the horde of Jokers by using Special Takedowns, you will arrive at The End, and you will be treated to a long sequence with Scarecrow, Gordon, and Robin as all of Gotham watches. When Scarecrow fills Batman with more
								fear toxin, you'll be transported to a very odd sequence where all is not as it appears. When you enter the Batmobile, open fire on...everything. You can use whatever you'd like - Vulcan Gun or 60mm Cannon to build up the vehicles
								Special Weapon charge, until you can at last get a prompt to unleash your special weapon.

								When the room is empty, exit the vehicle and enter the door to the side, and take out your enemies as you find them going down the corridors. There's no need for subtlety here as you might guess. Continue blasting your way through the
								building until you at last go outside to witness a terrifying vision of the future.

								When Scarecrow again injects Batman with more toxin, you'll find yourself in a very new scenario. Explore the corridors until you reach dead ends, and then turn around to find new paths open up. When you reach the Wake, you can find
								an exit through the chairs on one side, leading to another corridor.

								When you finally reach an open area, keep looking around as statues appear on all sides. Blast the statues apart as they appear until finally a new foe appears. Enter the light to find a long hall and push the Exit button on the far
								side. When at last you change sides, start beating up your opponent and knock him near the Intensive Treatment cell to perform an Environmental Takedown, shoving your nemesis in and at last sealing him away forever.

								Watch the ensuing scene and rejoice! You've completed the Main Story for Batman: Arkham Knight! After the scene concludes, you will be able to unlock one of two Endings if you have completed enough of Gotham's Most Wanted] (at least 7
								completed for the incomplete Knightfall Protocol, and all side quests completed to enact the True Knightfall Protocol). You can also start up New Game Plus at any time, or just continue to explore Gotham and fight crime for one last
								night.</p>
